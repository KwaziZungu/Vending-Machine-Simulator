## About This Application
This basic application simulates the functionality of a vending machine. The currency used is the south african rand (ZAR). <br>
What makes these machines fascinating is how they know exactly how many coins/bank notes to give out when the user recieves their change. <br>
<p> For example, if a user buys a R13 can of coke with a R20 bank note, the machine of course isn't going to return a R7 note since it doesn't exist, 
  but optimally it'll give the user R5 with a R2, or some other valid combination </p>
<p> This code emulates this process using basic functional programming. There are better methods of course some which include using recursion or the greedy algorithm.
In this application the user(with an initial balance of R50) selects an item, buys it, then their remain balance along with their change in terms of bank notes, is reflected.
If the user's balance is lower than the item's price then they can't purchase the item. For fun, they'll have an option to win an extra bank note selected randomly, and they get to
view their cart as well.</p>

## From The Author
<p> Note this app mainly served as a way for me to practise and showcase my basic programming and logical coding skills. A lot of programming deals with machine automation
similar to this but on a larger scale. The lack of a proper GUI and a solution involving some known computer science algorithms should be of no surprise.</p>
